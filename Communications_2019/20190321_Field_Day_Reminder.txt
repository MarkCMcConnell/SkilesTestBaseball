<p>Good&nbsp;Morning&nbsp;Skiles Test Families,</p>
<p>Just a quick reminder that Field Day is still on for this Saturday, March 23 from 9 AM to 2 PM.</p>
<h2><strong>Field Day - Saturday March 23 9 AM - 2 PM</strong></h2>
<p>Saturday March 23h is Field Day at Skiles Test. &nbsp;We would like everyone to come out and help prep the fields for the season. &nbsp;A lot of&nbsp;different work is available, we can find something for everyone. &nbsp;If you need inspiration in the morning, donuts and coffee will be provided.</p>
<p>Our primary task this year will be adding a significant amount of infield material to Westhoff&nbsp;Field.&nbsp; This field is used by our A League Baseball teams and we want it to be&nbsp;as great as our new Rookie and Softball fields.&nbsp; So bring some work gloves, rakes or shovels and help us get ready for the season.&nbsp; This will also be a great opportunity to check out our new facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Only a few spots remain!&nbsp; -- Register now before it is too late!</h2>
<h3>Registration is open and spots are still available in&nbsp;all leagues!&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Due to popular demand, we have opened additional spots in all of our leagues, however spots are limited.&nbsp; If you have a friend our relative that has been waiting to register, now is the time.</p>

<h2>Umpires - Put your Middle School and High School Kids to Work!</h2>
<p>Skiles Test employees (yes, pays!) youth umpires to officiate games. &nbsp;Professional umpires are also used in games, but we have a need for a lot of kids to work during the season. &nbsp;Games are scheduled most week nights and Saturdays. &nbsp;We schedule about a week in advance and we work around other schedules and conflicts. &nbsp;This is a great opportunity to get your older kids out of the house and start making there own money to spend. &nbsp;We have a great system to bring in inexperienced kids and turn them into confident umpires.</p>
