<div>Dear Skiles Test family,&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We've noticed you haven't registered yet, and want to invite you to help us BREAK IN OUR NEW FIELDS, FACILITIES, &amp; CONCESSIONS! They look amazing!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are very excited about our new amenities, and we think you will be too! This season will be a special one, and we'd love for you to be apart of it with us. Evaluations are this upcoming Sunday at Lawrence Central - sign up today, attend evaluations (unless your child/children is in the Rookies league), and look forward to an awesome season with brand new fields &amp; facilities!&nbsp;</div>
