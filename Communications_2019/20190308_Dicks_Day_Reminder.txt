<p>Good Morning&nbsp;Skiles&nbsp;Test Families,</p>
<p>Team assignments have been made for all leagues except&nbsp;for our Rookie League (T-Ball).&nbsp; If you haven't heard from your coaches already, you can expect that communication soon.&nbsp; Rookie League team assignments will be announced once team names have been determined.&nbsp; That should happen sometime next week.&nbsp; We're working on practice schedules so we can hit the fields as soon as they are ready after Field Day.</p>

<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Umpires - Put Your Middle School Kids to Work</strong></span> -&nbsp;Skiles Test employees (yes, pays!) youth umpires to officiate games. &nbsp;Professional umpires are also used in games, but we have a need for a lot of kids to work during the season. &nbsp;Games are scheduled most week nights and Saturdays. &nbsp;We schedule about a week in advance and we work around other schedules and conflicts. &nbsp;This is a great opportunity to get your older kids out of the house and start making there own money to spend. &nbsp;We have a great system to bring in inexperienced kids and turn them into confident umpires. For more information, <a href="http://www.skilestest.com/Site/About/Officials">visit our Officials page</a>.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Field Day</strong></span> - After our Shopping Day at Dick's, our next league event is Field Day.&nbsp; Stay tuned for more information including the exact date.&nbsp; This is a wonderful opportunity to give back to the league while forging relationships with other Skiles&nbsp;Test families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
