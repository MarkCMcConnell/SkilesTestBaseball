<p>Good morning all,</p>
<p>We are in need of additional youth umpires for the season. Skiles&nbsp;Test pays youth umpires to officiate games for our younger leagues. Candidates should be at least 13 years old and in the 7th grade.&nbsp;Umpires are scheduled a week in advance so we can work around other schedules and school activities. There is not a minimum amount an umpire is required to work, so even if you can only officiate&nbsp;a few games, it is a worthwhile experience. We have a great system to bring in inexperienced kids and turn them into confident umpires.</p>
<p><strong>There is an hour long training session this Saturday, April 13 from 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM for those interested.&nbsp;</strong></p>
