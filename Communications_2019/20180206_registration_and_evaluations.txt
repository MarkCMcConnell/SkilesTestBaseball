<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Pre-Season Player Evaluations&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>Evaluations are<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;Sunday</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;">February 24th </span></strong></span>at Lawrence Central High School</span>. &nbsp;You must bring your players sometime between 11:00 AM and 3:00 PM; expect it to take around 20 to 30 minutes to complete the activities. &nbsp;The last couple years we have setup a system to nearly eliminate lines and delays. &nbsp;Player registration will be available on-site, but have your player registered by&nbsp;Friday, February 22 at 5:00pm to shorten the time to complete evaluations. &nbsp;Everyone who has registered online and paid their deferred balance or requested a payment arrangement can skip "registration" and proceed straight to "<strong>Express Check-In</strong>".</p>
<p><em>* Rookie League players do not evaluate.&nbsp; You will be contacted about team assignments in March.</em></p>
<p>Programs like 'Bring-A-Friend' require all players to evaluate to maintain even teams.</p>
