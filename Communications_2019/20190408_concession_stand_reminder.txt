<p>Good Evening Skiles&nbsp;Test Families,</p>
<p>We're a week away from our first games and we're still looking for concession stand volunteers. Remember, you are expected to work one 2 hour shift per child enrolled in the league. If you have not signed up yet, you can do so&nbsp;<a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/70a0d49a8ab29a2f49-concession" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="Verified">here</a>.</p>
<p>For the first time, we are offering the option to pay $25 instead of working a shift in the concession stand. This fee will go to hire a teenager to work in your place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a teenager of your own, kids 13 and older are eligible to work their&nbsp;families shift at the stand.</p>
<p>We all love having a concession stand so our kids can get treats after the game, but we can't make it a reality without the entire community pitching in.</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>
