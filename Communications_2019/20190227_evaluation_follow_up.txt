<p>Thank you for everyone that came out for our preseason player evaluations.&nbsp; It was great to see everyone and start to discuss the upcoming season!&nbsp; We had incredible participation with 88% of registered players attending.&nbsp; Thank you to the coaches and volunteers that spent their day&nbsp;working and all the families that brought their player to be evaluated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Umpires - Put your Middle School and High School Kids to Work!</span></h2>
<p>Skiles Test employees (yes, pays!) youth umpires to officiate games. &nbsp;Professional umpires are also used in games, but we have a need for a lot of kids to work during the season. &nbsp;Games are scheduled most week nights and Saturdays. &nbsp;We schedule about a week in advance and we work around other schedules and conflicts. &nbsp;This is a great opportunity to get your older kids out of the house and start making there own money to spend. &nbsp;We have a great system to bring in inexperienced kids and turn them into confident umpires.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #003366;">More Sponsors Needed</span></h2>
<p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Help children play sports for less than 83 cents a day!</strong></span></em></p>
<p>We could use a few&nbsp;more sponsor for this season. &nbsp;Team sponsorships are a great way to show how your business or organization supports youth activities.</p>
<p>A good base of sponsors allows our league to keep registration fees low for our players and families.&nbsp; We strive to provide a fun and safe playing environment, competitive&nbsp;competition, well working and safe equipment, and high quality uniforms.&nbsp; These costs exceed what we charge our families, and sponsorships help cover the difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
