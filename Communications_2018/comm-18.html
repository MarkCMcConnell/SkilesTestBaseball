<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Umpires - We still need more Middle School and High School Kids to Work!</span></h2>
<p>Skiles Test employees (yes, pays!) youth umpires to officiate games. &nbsp;Professional umpires are also used in games, but we have a need for a lot of kids to work during the season. &nbsp;Games are scheduled most week nights and Saturdays. &nbsp;We schedule about a week in advance and we work around other schedules and conflicts. &nbsp;This is a great opportunity to get your older kids out of the house and start making there own money to spend. &nbsp;We have a great system to bring in inexperienced kids and turn them into confident umpires.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Grounds and Safety</span></h2>
<p>Skiles&nbsp;Test Elementary is under current renovation and that activity spreads into the parking lots and the grounds of Skiles&nbsp;Test Youth Baseball &amp; Softball.&nbsp; While you are at Skiles&nbsp;Test please keep everyone close by and don't allow anyone in the construction areas, this includes the location of the two fields being built.&nbsp; Now that the weather is improving we hope that the fields are build in a timely manner, but they are not a play area until after their completion.&nbsp; The area is already marked for construction to start and any activity in the area can disrupt the progress.&nbsp; This past weekend marking stakes for the new fields were pulled up which will require work to be redone.&nbsp; The area is accessible by the public, so we don't believe the damaged was caused by Skiles&nbsp;Test patrons, but this is a good reminder to make sure we set a good example.</p>
<p>While attending games always be aware of the activity on the fields.&nbsp; Baseballs and softballs tend to fly off the field in foul territory.&nbsp; Make sure your family is close and aware of the risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to baseball and softball games our fields do require preparation and markings.&nbsp; If you are interested in helping prior to your player's games we have some helpful instructions on our websites.&nbsp; Our coaches willsurley&nbsp;appreciate any help to allow them time to prepare their team to play ball.&nbsp; Instructions are available here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.skilestest.com/Site/Fields-Weather/Facilities/Field-Preparation" target="_blank">/Site/Fields-Weather/Facilities/Field-Preparation</a></p>
