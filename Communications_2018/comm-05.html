<p>Good&nbsp;morning Skiles Test Families,</p>
<p>Thank you to those that came out to our coaching and volunteer meet and greet last week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Skiles&nbsp;Test&nbsp;Elementary Property Improvements</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The&nbsp;Skiles Test Youth Baseball and Softball organization is ramping up for another great year of baseball and softball.&nbsp; We shared news at the end of last season and if you travel near Skiles Test Elementary School you will see obvious signs of the ongoing&nbsp;<span class="il">construction</span>&nbsp;project.&nbsp; The league has been working with the&nbsp;MSDLT&nbsp;Athletics and Operations leaders and upon completion we will have improved facilities for both the school and our league.&nbsp; This season is likely going to have alterations to accommodate the work on the school property that effects the two fields on the South-side of the property.&nbsp; Last season we started to use the fields at the Lawrence Education &amp; Community Center (LECC) on Sunnyside and 63rd St for practices.&nbsp; The league has committed to improving those fields which may be used for practices and potentially some league games if the fields at Skiles Test are not ready in time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We expect another great year of baseball and softball this season!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Welcome&nbsp;New Families!</span></h2>
<p>We have had a good number of new families joining us this year, and we are very glad you have chosen to play at&nbsp;Skiles&nbsp;Test for this upcoming season. &nbsp;We have a staff who is eager&nbsp;to help and a roster of long standing families that make Skiles&nbsp;Test the best league in town. &nbsp;We have a collection of pages on our web site under the About Us-&gt;Player section intended to help new participants get familiar with our league. &nbsp;There are some details below about our Evaluation Day event which is the first event of the season for all leagues, except Rookies who do not need to attend; we will have people available that day&nbsp;to discuss any questions or concerns you may have. &nbsp;If you have any additional questions, please reach out to <a href="mailto:enrollment@skilestest.com">enrollment@skilestest.com</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Pre-Season&nbsp;Evaluations</span></h2>
<p>Our&nbsp;pre-season evaluations is the first major event of the Skiles&nbsp;Test season. &nbsp;The last couple years we have setup a system to nearly eliminate lines and delays. &nbsp;We will need volunteers and coaches to help evaluate the players in preparation for the player draft. &nbsp;If you are interested in helping, please reach out to:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:enrollment@skilestest.com">enrollment@skilestest.com</a></p>
<p>Evaluations will be held on <strong>Sunday&nbsp;February 25th </strong>at Lawrence Central High School. &nbsp;You need to bring your players sometime between 11a and 4p - it takes around 20 to 30 minutes to complete the activities.</p>
