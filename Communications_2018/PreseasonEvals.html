<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Pre-Season&nbsp;Evaluations</span></h2>
<p>Our&nbsp;pre-season evaluations is the first major event of the Skiles&nbsp;Test season. &nbsp;The last couple years
    we have setup a system to nearly eliminate lines and delays. &nbsp;We will need volunteers and coaches to help
    evaluate the players in preparation for the player draft. &nbsp;If you are interested in helping, please reach out
    to:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:enrollment@skilestest.com">enrollment@skilestest.com</a></p>
<p>Evaluations will be held on <strong>Sunday&nbsp;February 25th </strong>at Lawrence Central High School. &nbsp;You
    need to bring your players sometime between 11a and 4p - it takes around 20 to 30 minutes to complete the
    activities.</p>
