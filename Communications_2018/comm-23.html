<h2><span style="color: #003366;">2018 Closing Ceremonies</span></h2>
<p>On Saturday June 16th following the last Championship game we will end the season with our Closing Ceremonies.&nbsp;
    All teams will be recognized and players will be awarded for the season.&nbsp; We will present our regular season
    and tournament champion and runner-up awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Have your players wear their uniform shirt (shorts and
    tennis shoes are fine) and gather with their teams at 2:15PM.&nbsp; Teams will be introduced following the
    conclusion of the last game, expected to be the Major League Baseball game.&nbsp; The Ceremonies will be hosted in
    the same area at Skiles&nbsp;Test as the Opening Ceremonies.&nbsp; The presentation should be brief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #339966;">End of Season Celebration Dinner -- Why not Chile Verde?</span></h2>

<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Parking at Skiles&nbsp;Test</span></h2>
<p>Yesterday afternoon we were notified by Lawrence Township Schools that the Skiles&nbsp;Test parking lot was going to
    be torn up immediately&nbsp;as part of the ongoing school and field&nbsp;construction.&nbsp; For the remaining games
    during this week there should be plenty of parking available&nbsp;- cars are able to park in the front lot and the
    bus pickup area.&nbsp; The back parking lot - although under repair - should be available throughout the week and
    the weekend for parking.&nbsp; It may be in a rough stone covering or fresh asphalt, but it should be uninhibited
    and available for use.&nbsp; Street parking is available in the surrounding neighborhoods for overflow.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Summer Baseball &amp; Softball Camps<br /></span></h2>
