<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Welcome&nbsp;New Families!</span></h2>
<p>We have had a good number of new families joining us this year, and we are very glad you have chosen to play
    at&nbsp;Skiles&nbsp;Test for this upcoming season. &nbsp;We have a staff who is eager&nbsp;to help and a roster of
    long standing families that make Skiles&nbsp;Test the best league in town. &nbsp;We have a collection of pages on
    our web site under the About Us-&gt;Player section intended to help new participants get familiar with our league.
    &nbsp;There are some details below about our Evaluation Day event which is the first event of the season for all
    leagues, except Rookies who do not need to attend; we will have people available that day&nbsp;to discuss any
    questions or concerns you may have. &nbsp;If you have any additional questions, please reach out to <a
        href="mailto:enrollment@skilestest.com">enrollment@skilestest.com</a>. &nbsp;</p>
