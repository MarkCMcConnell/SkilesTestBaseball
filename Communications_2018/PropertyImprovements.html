<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Skiles&nbsp;Test&nbsp;Elementary Property Improvements</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The&nbsp;Skiles Test Youth Baseball and Softball organization is ramping up for another
        great year of baseball and softball.&nbsp; We shared news at the end of last season and if you travel near
        Skiles Test Elementary School you will see obvious signs of the ongoing&nbsp;<span
            class="il">construction</span>&nbsp;project.&nbsp; The league has been working with
        the&nbsp;MSDLT&nbsp;Athletics and Operations leaders and upon completion we will have improved facilities for
        both the school and our league.&nbsp; This season is likely going to have alterations to accommodate the work on
        the school property that effects the two fields on the South-side of the property.&nbsp; Last season we started
        to use the fields at the Lawrence Education &amp; Community Center (LECC) on Sunnyside and 63rd St for
        practices.&nbsp; The league has committed to improving those fields which may be used for practices and
        potentially some league games if the fields at Skiles Test are not ready in time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We expect another great year of baseball and softball this season!</span></p>
