<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Concessions Help</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are looking for a few big helpers that are willing to help manage our concession stand this season.&nbsp; We have all new facilities on site at Skiles&nbsp;Test and we need someone who can help with the day to day operations.&nbsp; We use volunteers to help with the point of sale so a lot of support is available.&nbsp; This is a big job but very important to be able to provide this service.&nbsp; With additional games taking place at the LECC&nbsp;facility this season, while field work is completed at Skiles&nbsp;Test, we have an extra need this year to make concessions available.&nbsp; If you are interested in helping&nbsp;out, please contact: Tony Rondinella,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:president@skilestest.com">president@skilestest.com</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Umpires - Put your Middle School and High School Kids to Work!</span></h2>
<p>Skiles Test employees (yes, pays!) youth umpires to officiate games. &nbsp;Professional umpires are also used in games, but we have a need for a lot of kids to work during the season. &nbsp;Games are scheduled most week nights and Saturdays. &nbsp;We schedule about a week in advance and we work around other schedules and conflicts. &nbsp;This is a great opportunity to get your older kids out of the house and start making there own money to spend. &nbsp;We have a great system to bring in inexperienced kids and turn them into confident umpires.</p>
<p>If you are interested reach out to <a href="mailto:operations@skilestest.com">operations@skilestest.com</a></p>
<p>Applications are available at SkilesTest.com</p>
