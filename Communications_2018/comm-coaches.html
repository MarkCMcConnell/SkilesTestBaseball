<p>Good Morning Skiles&nbsp;Test Rookie Participants,</p>
<p>We are&nbsp;actively&nbsp;seeking additional coaches for this upcoming Spring season in the division your player participates.&nbsp; We have already had a great number of registrations and we will have more teams than expected.&nbsp; Additional coaches will allow us to build more teams&nbsp;each with a fewer number of players, providing more playing opportunity for everyone.&nbsp; The Rookie division is a great opportunity to start your coaching career.&nbsp; If you have any interest in coaching or participating, please let us know.&nbsp; Contact <a href="mailto:rookie@skilestest.com">rookie@skilestest.com</a>.&nbsp; If you are interested in coaching, but have concerns about experience or knowledge, we have a few different opportunities to help you out.</p>
<p>On <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Saturday February 24th</strong></span>, Skiles&nbsp;Test Youth Baseball &amp; Softball is hosting a coaching clinic in cooperation with the Lawrence Central High School Athletic Department and Bears Baseball.&nbsp; This event will be a great opportunity to learn the keys to scheduling a successful practice and experience drills that help youth learn the game and improve their skills.</p>

<p><br />For additional assistance for the coaches that may have troubles committing to being available for every practice, we can pair up multiple individuals who are willing to work cooperatively&nbsp;to coach a team.&nbsp; If you have interest, contact us and we can help pair you up with other willing individuals.</p>
<p>If you believe you have signed up to coach, but you have not been contacted yet directly by a board member, please contact us.</p>
