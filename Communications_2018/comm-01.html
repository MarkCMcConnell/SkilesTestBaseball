<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">** Upgrade your involvement **</span></h2>
<p>It takes a lot of help to run our league each season.&nbsp; Whether you are a parent, grandparent, alumni, coach, committee&nbsp;member, or if you just have time to lend a hand; let one of our&nbsp;board&nbsp;members know you are interested.&nbsp; There is no need to be a baseball and softball expert to get involved, we have plenty of tasks that cover all different areas.&nbsp; Our teams are divided&nbsp;into a few different groups:&nbsp; Concessions, Enrollment, Finance, Grounds, Operations, and Promotions.&nbsp; Contact our league president, Tony Rondinella&nbsp;email:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:president@skilestest.com" target="_blank">president@skilestest.com</a></p>
