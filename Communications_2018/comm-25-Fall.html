<p>Skiles&nbsp;Test is launching an inaugural Fall Series of Clinics to test interest in future Fall season activities.&nbsp; Available to all ages and genders the clinics will focus on baseball skills over a 6 week set of sessions each Sunday from 4:30pm - 7:30pm in September into October, each including an instructional session and a scrimmage.&nbsp; This schedule should allow you to participate in other fall sports and activities and still attend the clinics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Players and their parents are encouraged to attend as there will be a focus on drills that can be run at home to further improve your players skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Skiles&nbsp;Test has regularly played a Spring Recreational season for over 50 years and we added Softball in 2010.&nbsp; Fall baseball and softball leagues have gotten more popular and we need to decide if there is enough interest in Skiles&nbsp;Test running a Fall Program of its own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
