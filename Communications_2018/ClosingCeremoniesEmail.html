    <p><strong>Important</strong> - Please leave yourself available all days this week for games to allow us to finish the tournament this week. With
        some tournament games being dependent upon other ones this week, there may be short notice of your child having
        a game the next day.</p>
    <p>On Saturday June 15th, following the last Championship game, we will end the season with our Closing Ceremonies.
        All teams will be recognized and players will be awarded for the season. We will present our regular season and
        tournament champion and runner-up awards. Team and individual photos are in and will be given out at the
        ceremony. Have your players wear their uniform shirt (shorts and tennis shoes are fine) and gather with their
        teams at 3:00PM by the outfield fence of Frost field. Teams will be introduced following the conclusion of the
        last game, expected to be the Major League Baseball game. The Ceremonies will be hosted in the same area at
        as the Opening Ceremonies. The presentation should be brief.</p>
