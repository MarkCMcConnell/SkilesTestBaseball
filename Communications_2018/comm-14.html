<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Umpires - Put your Middle School and High School Kids to Work!</span></h2>
<p>Skiles Test employees (yes, pays!) youth umpires to officiate games. &nbsp;Professional umpires are also used in games, but we have a need for a lot of kids to work during the season. &nbsp;Games are scheduled most week nights and Saturdays. &nbsp;We schedule about a week in advance and we work around other schedules and conflicts. &nbsp;This is a great opportunity to get your older kids out of the house and start making there own money to spend. &nbsp;We have a great system to bring in inexperienced kids and turn them into confident umpires.</p>
<p>If you are interested reach out to <a href="mailto:operations@skilestest.com">operations@skilestest.com</a></p>
