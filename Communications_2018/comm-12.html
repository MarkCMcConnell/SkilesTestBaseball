<p>Good&nbsp;afternoon Skiles Test Families,</p>
<p>Thank you for everyone that came out for our preseason player evaluations.&nbsp; It was great to see everyone and start to discuss the upcoming season!&nbsp; Thank you to the coaches and volunteers that spent their day&nbsp;working and all the families that brought their player to be evaluated.&nbsp; Based on the responses we are already working on improvements for next season.&nbsp; If you have any thoughts or ideas, please share them with <a href="mailto:operations@skilestest.com">operations@skilestest.com</a>.</p>
<p>The number of teams per division will be set this week and we will only allow players to register to fill out the remaining spots to even out numbers between teams.&nbsp; Parents will be notified about team assignments in mid-March.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #003366;">More Sponsors Needed</span></h2>
<p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Help children play sports for less than 83 cents a day!</strong></span></em></p>
<p>We could use a few&nbsp;more sponsor for this season. &nbsp;Team sponsorships are a great way to show how your business or organization supports youth activities.</p>
<p>A good base of sponsors allows our league to keep registration fees low for our players and families.&nbsp; We strive to provide a fun and safe playing environment, competitive&nbsp;competition, well working and safe equipment, and high quality uniforms.&nbsp; These costs exceed what we charge our families, and sponsorships help cover the difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
