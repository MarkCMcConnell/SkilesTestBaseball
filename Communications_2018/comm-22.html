<p>Good morning Skiles Test Families,</p>
<p>Our postseason tournament is&nbsp;in full swing.&nbsp; This weekend gave us some grief with the weather.&nbsp; It is always hard to have a wet Saturday, last year we had a few during the regular season; rain on a Saturday during the tournament is even harder and when the following Sunday is wet as well, it creates unforeseen&nbsp;challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Postseason Tournament&nbsp; <span style="color: #ff0000;">**&nbsp; UPDATED SCHEDULE</span></span></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.skilestest.com/Site/News/Id/37922" target="_blank"><img src="https://app1.siplay.com/Files/GetEncoded?Id=4678435355647365717447796a384d6c6a4a413656513d3d" alt="" height="200" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The tournament schedule has been adjusted to account for the games missed this weekend.&nbsp; It appears the bad weather may continue early in the week, so we are providing advance notice in case today's games are not played.&nbsp; There is a&nbsp;likelihood&nbsp;Tuesday games could be in trouble as well; as long as we play one of those days we should be able to minimize the impact.&nbsp; The full schedule and updated bracket format is available here:&nbsp;<a href="https://siplay-website-content-user.s3.amazonaws.com/Portal/1690/Content/Documents/Schedules/ST_Postseason_Tournament_2018.pdf" target="_blank">/Content/Documents/Schedules/ST_Postseason_Tournament_2018.pdf</a></p>
<p>Please leave yourself available all days this week for games, including Friday and Sunday this week to allow us to finish the tournament by Saturday or Sunday at the latest.</p>
<p>More details and the full schedule are included in the article linked below, including a preview if Monday's games are postponed:</p>
