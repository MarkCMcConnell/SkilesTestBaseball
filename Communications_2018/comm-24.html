<h2><span style="color: #003366;">Fall Baseball &amp; Softball <span style="color: #ff0000;">** Your input is requested **</span></span></h2>
<p>Skiles&nbsp;Test has regularly played a Spring Recreational season for over 50 years and we added Softball in 2010.&nbsp; Fall baseball and softball leagues have gotten more popular and we need to decide if there is enough interest in Skiles&nbsp;Test running a Fall Program of its own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Next Season... a reason to Celebrate!</span></h2>
<p>Thank you to everyone for accommodating&nbsp;the construction around Skiles&nbsp;Test Elementary this past season.&nbsp; Next season we expect to be back to normal with all games being played at a single park.&nbsp; The investment we made at LECC&nbsp;will continue to benefit all players by expanding our field time for practices.&nbsp; It will be exciting to have the&nbsp;Skiles&nbsp;Test Game Day experience return to our park off Johnson Road.&nbsp;The facility improvements that were available this year with new bathrooms and concession stand has been a nice start.&nbsp; Before the season starts we will rededicate our two&nbsp;front fields as we start the next era of Skiles&nbsp;Test Youth Baseball &amp; Softball.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registration will open for Spring 2019 in December.</p>
