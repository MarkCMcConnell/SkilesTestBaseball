<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>You are being contacted because you have an order in your Skiles&nbsp;Test
            shopping cart that has not been checked out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orders must be completed to retain price discounts.&nbsp; In your case, you started your order with the early bird
    discount, but the order was not completed prior to the expiration.</p>
<p>Even though the offer has expired, we have adjusted your order to maintain the Early Bird discount.&nbsp; To maintain
    the discount, you still need to complete your order by checking out your shopping cart.</p>
<p>Please login to your SkilesTest.com account to complete your registration.&nbsp; You may still use our deferred
    payment option which will allow you to wait on payment for a few more weeks.&nbsp; To use the deferred&nbsp;payment
    option, select "Pay by Check" when you check out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact: enrollment@skilestest.com</p>
