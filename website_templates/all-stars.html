<p>Hello Skiles Test parents,</p>

<p>My name is Daniel Underwood and I am assisting in the coordination of All Star for all levels. As our 2019 season
    kicks off this week with our first games, I hope that you and your boys are off to a great beginning to the season.
    This certainly is an exciting time as we reunite with kids and parents who we haven&#39;t seen on the ball fields
    for several months, and it&#39;s always great to see the new families who are playing in the league for the first
    time. For those of you who have been in the league before, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware that we have an all star
    team named the Cobras. For those of you who aren&#39;t familiar with our talented Cobras team, here are a few
    highlights.</p>

<p>First and foremost, Skiles Test is a recreational league. Any Cobras practices or games will not interfere with the
    team your son plays on during the regular season. If something happens where there is a conflict between a Cobras
    event and the team your son plays on during the regular season, the rec team will take precedence. The Cobras will
    have all star teams at different age groups, and we&#39;ll have plenty of options for kids and parents who are
    looking to play additional baseball over the course of the season.</p>

<p>From the perspective of time commitment, we anticipate the all star teams to have two practices per week, beginning
    in early May. We will have double headers scheduled against area teams in May and June, typically happening on
    Sundays or at a time in an effort to not conflict with games scheduled with the rec teams. Beginning the last
    weekend in June, we&#39;ll enter the tournament season, during which we will play in local tournaments through the
    last weekend in July. As scheduling permits, some teams will have a tournament scheduled in July outside of
    Indianapolis in a Midwestern location, such as Cincinnati. We want kids and families to make as many games as
    possible, yet we recognize that people take vacations and have plans during the summer. The goal is for each team to
    carry enough kids to account for absences throughout the season.</p>

<p>Now for the next step...we will have all star tryouts for your age group on April 28. See below for times and fields.
    While there is a selection process with the coaching staff, we encourage anyone who is interested in playing at the
    next level to come out to the tryouts. We will be running a number of different drills to assess each kid. While
    kids are welcome to attend all tryouts, we recognize there may be conflicts in doing so, which is why we offer
    options for the kids to attend. If you have to miss, it&#39;s not an issue.</p>

<p>Our ultimate goal is to offer kids an additional opportunity to develop over the course of the summer. In prior
    seasons, we&#39;ve had some amazing experiences with the boys in practice and at the all star games, and it&#39;s
    truly something special to watch them improve their skills over the course of an extended season. There is also a
    new level of excitement in facing teams from other communities. As much as our boys learn from their coaches and
    peers at Skiles Test, there&#39;s something to be said in playing competition outside of our league. The kids build
    a further sense of pride, camaraderie, and teamwork that comes along with wearing a Skiles Test uniform.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, don&#39;t hesitate to contact me, and I look forward to seeing everyone at the diamonds
    very soon!</p>

<p>Daniel Underwood<br />
